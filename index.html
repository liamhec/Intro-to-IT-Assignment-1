          <h3> Background Information </h3>
          <p> Hi my names Liam, and I’m from Melbourne. Although being born in Darwin, I’ve lived in Melbourne my whole life, so I considered this home. I’ve completed primary and secondary education, completing VCE, I have also obtained my barista certificate, as who doesn’t love a good coffee. From a young age I’ve participated in taekwondo and I’m a first Dan black belt. </p>
					<h3>Information Technology</h3>
					<h4> Interst in Information Technology </h4>
          <p> My interest in IT has adapted and change over the years, starting off in primary school being exposed to basic programs on a computer, I had always been fascinated by computers. As I grew up I was always interested in different functionalities and learnt various things computers and mobile devices could do. I had become who my parents would come to, too fix any issues with their phones or computers. Entering secondary school, I gained an interest in programming, and wanting to learn how teach a computer to do something that I want it to do.  For my VCE project I created a program that would book holidays, which im proud that I was able to create and finish the project. I’ve always taken an interest in computers which also led me to learning how, and then building my own desktop. </p>
          <h4> Why I chose to study at RMIT </h4>
          <p> I chose to study at RMIT due to the course programs. I took interest in the Bachelor of Information and Technology degree, due to its broad range of study areas. I would like to pursue programming as a career, and this course allows for that, but it also teaches other aspects of information and technology, such as how computers actually work, which is something I find interesting. </p>
          <h4> What I expect to learn from RMIT </h4>
          <p> During my studies at RMIT expect to learn how to further my knowledge in programming, while also learning about how computers function and other aspects of information and technology. I hope that this course will lead me into the career that I’d like, and something that I find enjoyable. </P>

				<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
			</header>
			<p>Once I graduate I hope to find a job as a developer.</p>
			<p>... But to answer the question I would be looking at a Business Analyst role or Security Consultant in the future.
			I'm very much interested in the security field and business management, so I'd hope to move into one of those areas and continue learning of the many different facets of IT.
			While interested in transitioning into one of those fields, I would hope to have time available to allow for me to stay within the education sector.</p>
