				<h2>My Background</h2>
			</header>

				<section>
          <h3> Background Information </h3>
          <p> Hi my names Liam, and I’m from Melbourne. Although being born in Darwin, I’ve lived in Melbourne my whole life, so I considered this home. I’ve completed primary and secondary education, completing VCE, I have also obtained my barista certificate, as who doesn’t love a good coffee. From a young age I’ve participated in taekwondo and I’m a first Dan black belt. </p>
					<h3>Information Technology</h3>
					<h4> Interst in Information Technology </h4>
          <p> My interest in IT has adapted and change over the years, starting off in primary school being exposed to basic programs on a computer, I had always been fascinated by computers. As I grew up I was always interested in different functionalities and learnt various things computers and mobile devices could do. I had become who my parents would come to, too fix any issues with their phones or computers. Entering secondary school, I gained an interest in programming, and wanting to learn how teach a computer to do something that I want it to do.  For my VCE project I created a program that would book holidays, which im proud that I was able to create and finish the project. I’ve always taken an interest in computers which also led me to learning how, and then building my own desktop. </p>
          <h4> Why I chose to study at RMIT </h4>
          <p> I chose to study at RMIT due to the course programs. I took interest in the Bachelor of Information and Technology degree, due to its broad range of study areas. I would like to pursue programming as a career, and this course allows for that, but it also teaches other aspects of information and technology, such as how computers actually work, which is something I find interesting. </p>
          <h4> What I expect to learn from RMIT </h4>
          <p> During my studies at RMIT expect to learn how to further my knowledge in programming, while also learning about how computers function and other aspects of information and technology. I hope that this course will lead me into the career that I’d like, and something that I find enjoyable. </P>

			<p>Link to Job Ad https://www.seek.com.au/job/35830487?type=standard&userqueryid=a15bc833dc2b2a27b8259bce38463fa3-7095437</p>
<h3> Short description and why this job is appealing </h3>
    	<p>This job is asking for a Senior developer who has knowledge in programming with Java and Kotlin. This job is based in Melbourne and is a start-up company. I find this job appealing due to its location, as it means I don’t have to move to another city. I also find the job interesting as it’s a start-up. I’d enjoy working in a company that is relatively new and creating a brand-new product. </p>
<h3> Skills and experience required </h3>
<p> This job requires experience as a software developer with knowledge mainly in Java, and a few other languages, as well as knowledge with AWS. Although the ad doesn’t say, I would also assume the successful applicant would be able to work well in a team and have good problem-solving skills. </p>
<h3> Skills I currently have </h3>
<p> Currently, I’m learning Java in programming, I hope to continue to expand this knowledge. I’m also learning how to use AWS through this assignment, so I also hope to learn more about this service as it seems like a valuable skill to possess. I also believe I work well in a team and can solve problems without too much of an issue. </p>
<h3> How to further develop these skills </h3>
<p> Completing this course at RMIT will ultimately provide me with enough skills to find a job as a junior programming with skills in programming, and other aspects such as communication skills and a better knowledge of the I.T industry. I hope to continue programming and gain more knowledge about different languages, as well as java. I will need to get a job as a junior developer to gain experience working in the industry and what its like to work on an actual project. </p>

  <h3> Personality Test Results </h3>
  <h4> Myers-Briggs Test </h4>
  <p> Test from https://psychcentral.com/quizzes/personality/start.php </p>
  <img src="myers-Briggs.png" width="800" height= "600">
  <p> This result seems accurate to me as I feel as if I am responsible, and dependable while being organised and hard working. However, I disagree with sticking to traditions as I prefer to try something new and support what is new, rather than what is seen as traditional. This test probably highlights I should improve my social skills, which I think would be good for me. </p>
<h4> Learning Styles Test </h4>
<p> Test from http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml </p>
<img src="Learning-styles-test.png" width="800" height= "600">
<p> This test result also seems true to me. I definitely feel as though I learn better by doing things. I prefer to apply knowledge to learn, rather than just listen to the theory side. I believe that this reinforces the fact that I should study by doing things. </p>
<h4>The Big 5 Personality Test </h4>
<p> Test from https://my-personality-test.com/results/1049289486106585589/big-5 </P>
<img src="Big-5-Personality-Test(1).png" width="400" height= "300">
<img src="Big-5-Personality-Test(2).png" width="400" height= "300">
<p> This test highlights my issue with procrastination, which is something a do struggle with. It reinforces the fact that its something that I should work on. This test also contradicts the Myer Briggs test with my organisation. I think this is due to the fact that I prioritise certain things and they tend to be more organised than other things. </p>
<h3> What do these results mean for me? </h3>
<p> Looking at all the test results I feel as though they do reflect upon my personality. It highlights the need for me to focus on fixing issues, such as not procrastinating, and developing my social skills. The results also reinforce a few things that I’m aware of, such as the way I learn by doing things, rather than just listening. My organisation skills I feel are good which is shown but could be improved which is also highlighted with these results. So, these results have identified some areas in which I can further myself. </p>
<h3> How do I think these results may influence my behaviour in a team? </h3>
<p>Highlighted in the Myer-Briggs test, the hard work and dedication I can put into a project can be beneficial in a team. This paired with the dependability that’s shown, I feel will make a good combination in a team, as it suggests I will get the work done for the project without any issues. However, the procrastination suggested by the Big 5 Personality test somewhat contradicts this. This is an area which I’m aiming to improve, and I feel as though that I wouldn’t let the rest of my team down. </p>
<h3> How should I take this into account when forming a team </h3>
<p> When forming a team, I feel as though I should join with people who are like minded, and also hard working. I should be careful of my procrastination, and maybe be with a group who will make sure I avoid this, to ensure everything is done when it needs to be and to a good standard. </p>

<section id="Project Idea">

    <h2>Project Idea</h2>
  </header>
  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>I think it would be interesting to develop a small-scale robot that has the ability to move on its own. Whether this bot has the form as a car or an actual robot, it should be able to move on its own without crashing into obstacles. For this project a raspberry pi would probably be used, due to its small factor, which would allow it to easily fit into any shell. The software would need to be developed for this bot, and the ability to interpret data being inputted from sensors or cameras, while moving forward.</p>
  <h3>Motivation</h3>
  <p> I believe this project will be interesting due to the rapid pace of automated cars, vacuum cleaners and such rising and being sold on the market. This project would be on a smaller scale compared to these products, but the knowledge and experience gained would be useful in this new area of the I.T industry. With artificial intelligence (A.I) becoming a large sector of the I.T industry, this project would be a great start and look into what A.I is all about. Its expected that A.I could in fact become a $2.2 trillion opportunity by 2030 (ABC), so this industry is only expected to grow.</p>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p> This project involves developing an artificial intelligence (A.I), that can control a toy car without human input. The vehicle should be able to interpret data from a camera and make decisions such as the best way to avoid objects. A raspberry pi will have a program loaded onto it, that will ultimately control the cars actions. The program will be developed using java with a combination of two open source code libraries. The first open source code is called OpenCV. This open source code can be trained to detect objects through the use of a camera. This is essential as this is what will first identify objects and locate where they are. OpenCV is a good choice for this project as it works in java, but it also works with the raspberry pi camera in order to actually be able to identify objects. The other open source code that will accompany OpenCV is TensorFlow. TensorFlow can be used to actually make decisions based upon what OpenCV has identified. This might be one of the most important pieces to this project, as it will decide what to do when there is an object, and also it will control the basic functions such as steering and speed. This project will create essentially an artificial intelligence that could be used on other small projects and implemented as a solution to small objects that need the capability to control their own actions. This project will grant a small car the ability to move around without crashing into other objects, which could have a number of uses. Currently on this scale, vacuum cleaners are able to move around on their own and not crash into other objects, there are also lawn mowers that take this idea, and are to mow lawn by themselves without crashing. On a larger scale, actual cars are being developed to drive on their own, which means they need the drive without crashing into other cars, and pedestrians, while also steering and at high speeds. Creating a project like this on a smaller-scale demonstrates the power of artificial intelligence, and the capabilities of technology. This project should allow for a toy car to have the ability to have little to no human intervention. It should be able to steer on its own and select a reasonable speed to be travelling at. The car should also have the ability to identify any objects around it, especially in front of it, and make a decision on what to do in real time. Whether the decision to be stop, drive around it, or turn around, all these decisions should be made on its own. </p>
<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
<p>The artificial intelligence (A.I) will need to be programmed. A good language to use with raspberry pi would be JavaScript. This will allow for some open source software libraries to be used, to reduce the complexity of the project. For example, OpenCv can be used to detect objects, for this bot to not walk into objects. The project will need a shell, such as a car or a something similar, and a raspberry pi to control the vehicle, as well as a sensor or camera for data input, to identified objects and avoid them. </p>
<h3>Skills required</h3>
<p>Knowledge in Java will be needed in order to program this autonomous vehicle, and for it to be able to avoid obstacles. This will need to be accompanied with knowledge on how to implement this onto a raspberry pi in order to control the vehicle. Also, some knowledge in open source code will be needed in order to also implement this. The main part of special hardware needed in a pi camera, in order to see objects, and therefore know how to react. Raspberry pi and the pi camera are readily available online, as well as the open source code, being able to program this bot shouldn’t be too difficult to find people who have some knowledge in java, and we can build upon this. </p>
<h3>Outcome</h3>
<p>If this project is successful, there will be a small car with the ability to drive on its own, and avoid objects, without crashing into them. The software could be applied to other small objects, possibly with some small amount of tweaking. The impact of this project would be more upon the team who are working on it. It will expose us to the rapidly growing sector of the I.T industry, artificial intelligence. This project would provide a somewhat decent idea of the type of work goes into developing an A.I and how it can be implemented in real world problems, as well as the process in which is undertaken in order to implement something like this.</p>
