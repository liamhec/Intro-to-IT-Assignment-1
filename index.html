				<h2>My Background</h2>
			</header>

				<section>
          <h3> Background Information </h3>
          <p> Hi my names Liam, and I’m from Melbourne. Although being born in Darwin, I’ve lived in Melbourne my whole life, so I considered this home. I’ve completed primary and secondary education, completing VCE, I have also obtained my barista certificate, as who doesn’t love a good coffee. From a young age I’ve participated in taekwondo and I’m a first Dan black belt. </p>
					<h3>Information Technology</h3>
					<h4> Interst in Information Technology </h4>
          <p> My interest in IT has adapted and change over the years, starting off in primary school being exposed to basic programs on a computer, I had always been fascinated by computers. As I grew up I was always interested in different functionalities and learnt various things computers and mobile devices could do. I had become who my parents would come to, too fix any issues with their phones or computers. Entering secondary school, I gained an interest in programming, and wanting to learn how teach a computer to do something that I want it to do.  For my VCE project I created a program that would book holidays, which im proud that I was able to create and finish the project. I’ve always taken an interest in computers which also led me to learning how, and then building my own desktop. </p>
          <h4> Why I chose to study at RMIT </h4>
          <p> I chose to study at RMIT due to the course programs. I took interest in the Bachelor of Information and Technology degree, due to its broad range of study areas. I would like to pursue programming as a career, and this course allows for that, but it also teaches other aspects of information and technology, such as how computers actually work, which is something I find interesting. </p>
          <h4> What I expect to learn from RMIT </h4>
          <p> During my studies at RMIT expect to learn how to further my knowledge in programming, while also learning about how computers function and other aspects of information and technology. I hope that this course will lead me into the career that I’d like, and something that I find enjoyable. </P>

			<p>Link to Job Ad https://www.seek.com.au/job/35830487?type=standard&userqueryid=a15bc833dc2b2a27b8259bce38463fa3-7095437</p>
<h3> Short description and why this job is appealing </h3>
    	<p>This job is asking for a Senior developer who has knowledge in programming with Java and Kotlin. This job is based in Melbourne and is a start-up company. I find this job appealing due to its location, as it means I don’t have to move to another city. I also find the job interesting as it’s a start-up. I’d enjoy working in a company that is relatively new and creating a brand-new product. </p>
<h3> Skills and experience required </h3>
<p> This job requires experience as a software developer with knowledge mainly in Java, and a few other languages, as well as knowledge with AWS. Although the ad doesn’t say, I would also assume the successful applicant would be able to work well in a team and have good problem-solving skills. </p>
<h3> Skills I currently have </h3>
<p> Currently, I’m learning Java in programming, I hope to continue to expand this knowledge. I’m also learning how to use AWS through this assignment, so I also hope to learn more about this service as it seems like a valuable skill to possess. I also believe I work well in a team and can solve problems without too much of an issue. </p>

  <h3> Personality Test Results </h3>
  <h4> Myers-Briggs Test </h4>
  <p> Test from https://psychcentral.com/quizzes/personality/start.php </p>
  <img src="myers-Briggs.png">
  <p> This result seems accurate to me as I feel as if I am responsible, and dependable while being organised and hard working. However, I disagree with sticking to traditions as I prefer to try something new and support what is new, rather than what is seen as traditional. This test probably highlights I should improve my social skills, which I think would be good for me. </p>
<h4> Learning Styles Test </h4>
<p> Test from http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml </p>
<img src="Learning-styles-test.png">
<p> This test result also seems true to me. I definitely feel as though I learn better by doing things. I prefer to apply knowledge to learn, rather than just listen to the theory side. I believe that this reinforces the fact that I should study by doing things. </p>
<h4>The Big 5 Personality Test </h4>
<p> Test from https://my-personality-test.com/results/1049289486106585589/big-5 </P>
<img src="Big-5-Personality-Test(1).png">
<img src="Big-5-Personality-Test(2).png">
<p> This test highlights my issue with procrastination, which is something a do struggle with. It reinforces the fact that its something that I should work on. This test also contradicts the Myer Briggs test with my organisation. I think this is due to the fact that I prioritise certain things and they tend to be more organised than other things. </p>
<h3> What do these results mean for me? </h3>
<p> Looking at all the test results I feel as though they do reflect upon my personality. It highlights the need for me to focus on fixing issues, such as not procrastinating, and developing my social skills. The results also reinforce a few things that I’m aware of, such as the way I learn by doing things, rather than just listening. My organisation skills I feel are good which is shown but could be improved which is also highlighted with these results. So, these results have identified some areas in which I can further myself. </p>
<h3> How do I think these results may influence my behaviour in a team? </h3>
<p>Highlighted in the Myer-Briggs test, the hard work and dedication I can put into a project can be beneficial in a team. This paired with the dependability that’s shown, I feel will make a good combination in a team, as it suggests I will get the work done for the project without any issues. However, the procrastination suggested by the Big 5 Personality test somewhat contradicts this. This is an area which I’m aiming to improve, and I feel as though that I wouldn’t let the rest of my team down. </p>
<h3> How should I take this into account when forming a team </h3>
<p> When forming a team, I feel as though I should join with people who are like minded, and also hard working. I should be careful of my procrastination, and maybe be with a group who will make sure I avoid this, to ensure everything is done when it needs to be and to a good standard. </p>
